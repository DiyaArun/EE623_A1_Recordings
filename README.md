# EE623_A1_Recordings

As part of this assignment, we have recorded and observed one instance of letters in the Kannada alphabet. This repository contains all recodings of the same. 

The Kannada alphabet containing 49 letters is divided into 4 parts -
  * 13 Swaras - the vowels
  * 2 Yogavaahakas - neither vowels nor consonants (or in some text partly both) [Anuswara and Visarga]
  * 25 Vargeeya Vyanjanas - structured consonants [5 each Velar, Palatal, Retroflex, Dental and Labial (in that order), the last of each group is always nasal and the remaining are plosives or affricates]
  * 9 Avargeeya Vyanjanas - unstructured consonants
